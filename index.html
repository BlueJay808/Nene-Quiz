        <p class="info-title">Description:</p>
        <p class="info">The Nene is one of 30 bird species in Hawaii that the state and federal governments have designated as endangered. Because the nēnē is classified as the state bird, it is important for the state to keep them from going extinct. Not only is it a landmark species for Hawaii, but it also plays an important role in our ecosystem and is a cultural symbol. The nēnē are considered the guardian spirits of the land in Hawaiian culture. They are the symbolic force joining the mountains and the coast because of their seasonal movement patterns.</p>

        <p class="info-title">Conservation Status:</p>
        <p class="info">The nēnē is listed as a threatened species by the federal government. On the state level, they are listed as endangered. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has the nēnē listed as vulnerable, while NatureServe ranks them as Critically Imperiled.</p>

        <p class="info-title">Distribution:</p>
        <p class="info">Past: The Hawaiian Goose used to be found on all main Hawaiian Islands.</p>
        <p class="info">Present: They are now only found on the island of Hawai'i, Maui, Kaua'i, Moloka'i, and Oahu.</p>

    <div class="info-div">
        <p class="info-title">Habitat:</p>
        <p class="info">Past: Lowland dry forests, shrublands, grassland, and montane dry forests.</p>
        <p class="info">Present: They currently utilize a wide range of habitats, such as coastal dune vegetation, nonnative grasslands (such as golf courses, pastures, and rural areas), sparsely vegetated low- and high-elevation lava flows, midelevation native and nonnative shrubland, early successional cinderfall, cinder deserts, native alpine grasslands, and shrubland-woodland community interfaces, which are both native and nonnative. Nesting takes place in a number of environments, including grassland, lava rock, shrubland, and beach strand, as well as at various elevations.</p>

        <p class="info-title">Threats:</p>
        <p class="info">The nēnē is an endangered species native to Hawaii. There used to be at least five different species of geese in Hawaii; however, only the nēnē remains. In the past, the nēnē have been threatened by habitat loss, hunting, and predation by rats, cats, dogs, and small Indian mongoose. Current threats include invasive species, and diseases that spread from those invasive species. There can also be nutritional deficiencies because of the loss of habitat. Human disturbances have been another common cause of deaths. Some examples are road mortality, aircraft strikes, and collisions with wind turbines.</p>

    <div class="info-div">
        <p class="info-title">How to Help:</p>
        <p class="info">"Different species become endangered for different reasons.  In the case of the Nene, keeping invasive pets, such as dogs and cats on a leash, and driving with Aloha, especially when near Nene habitat, is a good start. This is a really easy and effective solution that I think everyone listening can abide by. Just keep your animals leashed and drive carefully." - Charles Lee, an education specialist at the Honolulu Zoo</p>
